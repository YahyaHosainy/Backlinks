                                two weeks).

                                The links are permanent in typical cases, as we use high-quality, unique articles in
                                submission and submit in high-quality sites. Still, in some instances, the sites may
                                bulk delete accounts/articles, or sites may down after some time, so it is about 80%
                                permanent as per our statics.

                                We have a team that manages the system. But if you mean the backlinks submission,
                                yes, it is a software process to save time to offer such low prices.
                                Some of our services were manually submitted like PR9 & Do-Follow, and some others
                                are semi-automated like some of the web 2.0 submissions. Still, we already updated
                                our system/scripts to submit in those hard sites, with the same quality appearance
                                and results. We review our sites list monthly to ensure every site is a good
                                authority site for our customers.
